# Streak reminders (Telegram)

Every Saturday at 18:00, `streak:remind` checks every user with an active Telegram connection and `notify_weekly_recap = true`. If the user has a live streak but hasn't run yet this week, it dispatches a Telegram nudge: one message per user, per at-risk week, no repeats.

## Flow

1. **Cron** (Saturday 18:00, see [routes/console.php](routes/console.php#L72)) fires `StreakRemindCommand::handle()`.
2. The command queries all active Telegram connections with `notify_weekly_recap = true`, iterates each user, and applies four guards:
   - Skip if user is `is_demo` or null.
   - Skip if `WeeklySnapshot::consecutiveWeekStreak($userId)` returns `< 1` (no live streak).
   - Skip if the current week's `WeeklySnapshot` already has `runs > 0`.
   - Skip if `claim()` fails — `insertOrIgnore` on `streak_reminders` with a unique `(user_id, week_ending)` constraint, so repeated cron runs never double-send.
3. Sends `StreakReminderNotification($streakWeeks)` to the user via `$user->notify()`.

The notification's `via()` re-checks the guards at send time (not demo, Telegram connection active, `notify_weekly_recap` still true); the [TelegramChannel](../../app/Notifications/Channels/TelegramChannel.php) then calls `TelegramClient::sendMessage` with:

> 🔥 Streak lari {n} minggu kamu belum ada progres minggu ini. Sempatkan lari sebelum minggu ini berakhir, biar streak-nya nggak putus.

The link points to the dashboard. See [[telegram-notifications]] for the broader Telegram integration.

## Idempotency

- `streak_reminders` table has a unique `(user_id, week_ending)` constraint — the same user in the same at-risk week can only receive one reminder, even if the command runs multiple times or the cron host restarts mid-iteration.
- The notification's `via()` re-checks connection status and opt-in at send time, so a user who disconnects Telegram between dispatch and execution is never pestered.

## Schedule rationale

Saturday 18:00 gives the user a ~30-hour window (Saturday evening through Sunday midnight) to save their streak before the week closes. Earlier in the week would be premature (they might run Tuesday-Thursday); Sunday would be too late.

## Storage

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `streak_reminders` | Idempotency ledger: `(user_id, week_ending)` unique pair, no Eloquent model, accessed via `DB::table()` |

## Key dependencies

- `WeeklySnapshot::consecutiveWeekStreak()` — walks backward through contiguous running weeks; returns 0 if the most recent run is older than last Sunday.
- `TelegramConnection` — the opt-in connection model; `isRevoked()` checks for a null `revoked_at`.
